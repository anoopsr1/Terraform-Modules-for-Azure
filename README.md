This repository contains Terraform Modules I have created for Azure. Feel free to use these as you wish! ðŸ˜„

## How to Deploy

### :heavy_check_mark: Install the Right Tools First!

I have setup a Chocolatey script that will provide all the tools you need to work with Terraform on Azure - see [here](https://github.com/jakewalsh90/Terraform-Azure/blob/main/Chocolatey-Setup/TerraformApps.ps1).

### :arrow_right: GitHub Actions or Manual Deployment?

These projects can be deployed easily either Manually or using GitHub Actions - for a full guide, please see [here](https://github.com/jakewalsh90/Terraform-Azure/tree/main/GitHub-Actions-Deployment).

If you are new to Terraform, please check out my Getting Started with Azure Terraform Blog Series [here](https://jakewalsh.co.uk/category/terraform-getting-started/)
